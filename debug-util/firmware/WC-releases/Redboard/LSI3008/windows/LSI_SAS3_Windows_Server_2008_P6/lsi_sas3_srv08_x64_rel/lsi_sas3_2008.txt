1.0 Introduction for Windows Server 2008  


Windows Server 2008 is an operating system designed to run on Intel
architecture (x86, 32-bit), Itanium Processor Family (IA64), and Extended-64
(x64, AMD64/EM64T) processors using current technology. It provides a graphical
user interface environment incorporating many high-level features. Refer to the
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows Server 2008. To address a
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows
Server 2008 provides class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral
manufacturers, may be added to support new devices. Tape device support is
built into the operating system itself and does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
driver, which is called LSI_SAS3.SYS.  This driver completes the path to the
LSI controller or processor with an optional SAS BIOS.

This miniport driver uses the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  This miniport driver is
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The LSI_SAS3.SYS miniport driver supports these features:

o  Supports End-to-End Data Protection (EEDP)
o  Supports 1.5Gb, 3Gb, and 6Gb SAS expanders/devices and SATA devices
o  Supports PCI-Express bus protocols
o  Supports MSI/MSI-X
o  Supports LSI Fusion-MPT common software interface 
o  Supports multiple host adapters 
o  Supports multiple Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) 
o  Supports Scatter-Gather 
o  Supports SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Supports disk array configurations with no LUN 0 
o  Supports disk array configurations with non-contiguous LUNs 
o  Supports Storport Interrupt Redirection performance enhancements 
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: 1 Mbyte (32-bit), 2 Mbyte (64-bit)
.........................................................................
1.2 LSI Devices Supported 

o  LSISAS3004
o  LSISAS3008
o  LSISAS3108
o  LSISAS3116
o  LSISAS3208
o  LSISAS3308

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The LSI_SAS3.SYS driver meets the Microsoft specification for miniport
drivers.  This driver allows connection of SAS devices including disk drives,
CD/DVD-ROMs, and tape drives for PCI-Express based machines. To support a
different SAS device type, the Windows Server 2008 architecture requires that
a class driver for that type of device be present (usually supplied by
Microsoft, or possibly by the peripheral manufacturer). No changes to the LSI
driver is required. The driver supports only Windows Server 2008 and all
subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to  SAS Protocol devices
by using the SCSI pass-through facility.This facility allows applications to
directly control and access devices byfilling in a data structure and 
calling into the port or class driver. Refer to the Microsoft Windows Server 
2008 documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SAS3.SYS Driver


This procedure installs the LSI_SAS3.SYS driver onto a new or existing Windows
Server 2008 system. Depending upon the media used to distribute LSI drivers
(web or CD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you will create a driver install
package on some type of accessible media.  This can be a diskette, CD or DVD,
or USB flash drive.  The driver install package can also be placed on a hard
disk for driver upgrades only.

Copy the files listed in this section to a folder on the desired media as
shown below. You will use this driver package during the installation process.

        lsi_sas3.inf
        lsi_sas3.sys
        lsinodrv.inf
        lsi_sas3.cat
        
Note: Windows Server 2008 drivers must be either Release signed (by LSI) or
      WHQL logo signed (by Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs) to be
      installed on Server 2008.  Any modifications to any of the above files
      will invalidate the digital signature of the package and Server 2008 will
      not install the driver.

............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_SAS3.SYS driver onto a Windows Server 2008
system. Use this procedure when installing Windows Server 2008 onto an unused
drive. Windows Server 2008 automatically adds the driver to the registry and
copies the driver to the driver storage area.

............................................................................
2.1.1 DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows Server 2008 installation by booting from the Windows
   Server 2008 DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may need
   to be changed to allow DVD-ROM booting.
   
2. Proceed with the installation of Windows Server 2008. When the screen
   displays "Where do you want to install Windows?", click on the Load Driver
   icon.
   
3. Be sure the media with the LSI_SAS3 driver install package for the system
   processor architecture is inserted in the system.  Click the Browse button,
   browse to the location of the driver package, then click OK.
   
   Note: Current Windows Server 2008 drivers can be downloaded from the LSI
         Corporation web site at:
             http://www.lsi.com/cm/DownloadSearch.do
         After you are connected to this web site, select the product
         category, family, and the appropriate product.  Select the desired
         Windows Server 2008 driver to begin the download.
   
4. The LSI adapter driver name will be displayed, click Next.

    Note: When using a Release Signed driver, a Windows Security dialog box may
          appear, indicating that the publisher of this software is LSI
          Corporation. Click the Install button to continue installation of the
          driver.
            
          A second Windows Security dialog box may appear, indicating that a
          LSI system device is being installed.  This is to install
          drivers for LSI storage enclosure processors.  Click the Install
          button to continue installation of the driver.
   
5. Follow the Microsoft Windows Server 2008 installation procedure at this
   point.

2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows Server 2008

Windows Server 2008 has registry entries that can be used to tune the
performance of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of
NumberOfRequests and MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no
effect on the LSI_SAS3.SYS driver.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SAS3.SYS driver is configured by default to provide optimum
performance in most standard systems.

............................................................................
2.4 WinPE Installation

WinPE is provided to system OEM's to create a Pre-install Environment image.
To use the LSI_SAS3.SYS driver with the Windows Server 2008 based WinPE,
perform the steps listed below.

1. Create an lsi_sas3 folder in the winpe_image directory under i386\system32.
   For example: mkdir winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas3
 
2. Copy the lsi_sas3 driver package to the winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas3
   folder.

3. Edit the winpe_image\i386\System32\Winpeoem.sif to remove the semicolons
   from the [OemDriverParams] section and add the name of the lsi_sas3
   directory to the OemDriverDirs entry. For example:

   [OemDriverParams]
   OemDriverRoot = ""
   OemDriverDirs = lsi_sas3
 
4. You can then use oscdimg to create a bootable .iso image, or follow the
   WinPE User’s Guide to create a bootable USB flash device.

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SAS3.SYS driver will log error messages to the system error log. For
these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11, and the specific error
code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data should be displayed in words.
